Build out particle data sets for realizations (sequential run with particle resets):
  parallel_aggreate.sh
or
  on_node_aggregate.sh or parallel_aggregate_realizations.sh for folders with realizations in them

Turn realizations into dispersion and diffusivities via clusters:
  parallel_diffusivity_binning_complete.sh
