# MPAS-QuickViz
A public repository for the development and sharing of new analysis and visualization scripts

Here are the rules for MPAS-QuickViz (or lack thereof):

1. Push changes directly to head of https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-QuickViz
2. No pull requests or reviews are needed, unless you would like one.  This means that personal forks of MPAS-QuickViz are not needed.
3. Only restriction is to not overwrite files others have uploaded, without asking them.
4. Repo can hold any type of visualization or analysis script.
5. Scripts are not required to work in any particular way - i.e. not all cases, resolutions, etc.  The purpose is for the convenience of sharing scripts of any kind.  Scripts do not come with any guarantees.
6. Files may include binary parts, such as Jupyter pages with graphics.
7. There are no file size restrictions, but try not to overload your Jupyter pages with extra graphics.
8. When the repository becomes too large (>~100MB) we reserve the right to purge the history in order to reduce the size.
